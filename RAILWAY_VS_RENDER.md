## üí° **My Recommendation for Your Project**

### **Start with Render** 
Given that you're:
- Building a portfolio/learning project
- Want simple, predictable deployment
- Need more free tier hours for development
- Prefer straightforward setup

### **Consider Railway Later** 
When you:
- Have paying users who need instant responses
- Need advanced scaling and monitoring
- Want to eliminate cold starts completely  
- Have budget for infrastructure costs

## üîÑ **Migration Path**

The beauty is that **both platforms support the same deployment model**:

```bash
# Your code works on both platforms
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Start Command: npm start
Environment Variables: Same for both
```

**Easy Migration:**
1. Deploy to Render first (easier setup)
2. Get your app working and users engaged
3. Migrate to Railway later if you need better performance
4. Both use same Docker/buildpacks, minimal changes needed

## üé® **For Exhibition Curator Specifically**

### **Render Fits Better Because:**
- **Art browsing apps** can tolerate cold starts (users browse slowly)
- **Portfolio project** benefits from longer free tier
- **Simple architecture** doesn't need Railway's advanced features
- **Learning focus** benefits from Render's better docs

### **Railway Would Be Better If:**
- **Real-time features** (chat, live collaboration)
- **High-traffic production** app with paying users
- **Complex microservices** architecture
- **Enterprise deployment** requirements

**Bottom Line:** Start with Render, migrate to Railway if you outgrow it! üöÄ
