# API Routes Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Routes Defined
All major API routes have been defined across the following route files:

# Authentication Routes (`/api/auth`)

- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile

### User Routes (`/api/users`)
- `GET /users` - Get all users
- `GET /users/:user_id` - Get user profile
- `PATCH /users/:user_id` - Update user profile
- `DELETE /users/:user_id` - Delete user account
- `GET /users/:user_id/exhibitions` - Get user's exhibitions
- `GET /users/:user_id/favorites` - Get user's favorites

### Exhibition Routes (`/api/exhibitions`)
**Public Routes:**
- `GET /exhibitions/public` - Get all public exhibitions
- `GET /exhibitions/public/:exhibition_id` - Get public exhibition details
- `GET /exhibitions/shared/:shareable_link` - Get exhibition by link
- `GET /exhibitions/search` - Search exhibitions
- `GET /exhibitions/featured` - Get featured exhibitions
- `GET /exhibitions/trending` - Get trending exhibitions

**Protected Routes:**

- `PATCH /exhibitions/:exhibition_id/artworks/:artwork_id` - Update artwork
- `DELETE /exhibitions/:exhibition_id/artworks/:artwork_id` - Remove artwork
- `POST /exhibitions/:exhibition_id/share` - Share exhibition
- `DELETE /exhibitions/:exhibition_id/share` - Unshare exhibition

### Artwork Routes (`/api/artworks`)
**All Public Routes:**
- `GET /artworks/search` - Search all museums
- `GET /artworks/random` - Get random artworks
- `GET /artworks/departments` - Get categories
- `GET /artworks/:artwork_id` - Get artwork details
- `GET /artworks/met/search` - Search Met Museum
- `GET /artworks/met/:object_id` - Get Met artwork
- `GET /artworks/rijks/search` - Search Rijksmuseum
- `GET /artworks/rijks/:object_id` - Get Rijks artwork

### Favorites Routes (`/api/favorites`)
**All Protected Routes:**
- `GET /favorites` - Get current user's favorites
- `POST /favorites` - Add to favorites
- `DELETE /favorites/:artwork_id` - Remove from favorites
- `GET /favorites/search` - Search within favorites

## üöß Next Steps Required

### 1. Create Missing Controllers
You'll need to implement controller functions for:

**Auth Controller (`src/controllers/auth.ts`):**
- `register`, `login`, `logout`, `refreshToken`, `getCurrentUser`

**User Controller (update `src/controllers/users.ts`):** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Add `getUserExhibitions` - Supports both `/me/exhibitions` and `/:user_id/exhibitions`
- ‚úÖ Add `getUserFavorites` - Supports pagination, filtering, sorting, and both `/me/favorites` and `/:user_id/favorites`

**Exhibition Controller (update `src/controllers/exhibitions.ts`):**
- Add `updateArtworkInExhibition`, `getPublicExhibitions`, `getSharedExhibition`
- Add `shareExhibition`, `unshareExhibition`, `searchExhibitions`
- Add `getFeaturedExhibitions`, `getTrendingExhibitions`

**Artwork Controller (update `src/controllers/artworks.ts`):**
- Add `getRandomArtworks`, `getDepartments`
- Add `searchMetMuseum`, `searchRijksmuseum`, `getMetArtwork`, `getRijksArtwork`

**Favorites Controller (`src/controllers/favorites.ts`):**
- `getUserFavorites`, `addToFavorites`, `removeFromFavorites`, `searchFavorites`

**Loading Systems Controller (`src/controllers/loadingSystem.ts`):**
- `getLoadingStatus`, `updateLoadingProgress`, `cacheArtworkData`
- `preloadUserFavorites`, `backgroundImageOptimization`, `batchLoadArtworks`

### 2. Loading Systems & Performance
Implement comprehensive loading and caching mechanisms:

**Caching Layer:**
- Redis integration for artwork metadata caching
- Image URL caching with expiration policies
- Search result caching for popular queries
- User-specific cache warming (favorites, recent searches)

**Background Processing:**
- Queue system for artwork image preprocessing
- Batch loading for exhibition creation
- Progressive data loading for large collections
- Background sync for external API updates

**Loading State Management:**
- Real-time loading progress tracking
- Skeleton loading states for frontend
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Connection status monitoring for external APIs

**Performance Optimization:**
- Lazy loading for artwork images
- Pagination with prefetching
- Database query optimization
- CDN integration for static assets

### 3. Update Database Models
The embedded document structure in `User.ts` should support:
- `isPublic` flag for exhibitions
- `shareableLink` for exhibitions
- `viewCount`, `featured`, `trending` properties
- Artwork position/ordering within exhibitions
- User notes for artworks in exhibitions

### 3. Middleware Enhancements
Update `src/middleware/auth.ts` to handle:
- Optional authentication (for public routes that benefit from user context)
- Role-based permissions (admin features)
- Rate limiting for external API calls

## üìù Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clear Structure**: All endpoints are mapped out before implementation
2. **RESTful Design**: Follows standard REST conventions
3. **Security**: Authentication properly separated from data routes
4. **Scalability**: Routes organized by feature domain
5. **Flexibility**: Public/private routes clearly distinguished
6. **Future-Ready**: Easy to add new features like social interactions

You can now implement the controllers one by one, knowing exactly what endpoints each needs to handle!
